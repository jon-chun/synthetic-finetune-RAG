**Date:** [Date Submitted]
**(Target Length: Approx. 2 Pages - Be Concise!)**

---

**Executive Summary:**
*(Provide a 2-4 sentence summary capturing the project's goal, key method (fine-tuning RAG for your domain), main result (e.g., % improvement on key metric), and primary conclusion.)*

---

## 1. Domain Context & Data

* **Domain & Challenge:** Briefly describe the specialized domain and state *why* it challenges generic RAG models. Give 1-2 clear examples of specific terminology or concepts illustrating this.
* **Data:** Identify the source(s) of your initial text data. Briefly describe the dataset (type, size) and justify its relevance. Mention critical preprocessing.

---

## 2. Methodology Summary

* **Synthetic Data:** Briefly describe your approach (tool/method, # examples).
* **Fine-Tuning:** State the base model(s). Summarize only the *key choices* (e.g., loss function) and *final outcomes* (e.g., final eval score/metric, approx. training time). *Refer to code/logs (link if possible, e.g., W&B) for full hyperparameters.*
* **RAG Pipelines:** Briefly state the configurations compared (Baseline vs. Fine-Tuned).

---

## 3. Benchmark Design

* **Test Set:** Describe the composition (# questions) and rationale for your benchmark Q&A test set, explaining how it covers representative and challenging domain-specific cases.
* **Metrics:** State the primary metric(s) used. **Focus on metrics evaluating the retrieval step (e.g., Hit Rate@k, MRR) as these directly reflect the embedding model's impact.** Briefly justify your choice.

---

## 4. Benchmark Results

* **Quantitative:** Present the main results concisely, **using a table** comparing the performance of the baseline vs. fine-tuned (and any extra credit) systems on your key metric(s).

    ```
    | System Configuration | Metric 1 Name | Metric 2 Name (Optional) |
    |----------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
    | Baseline             | [Score]       | [Score]                  |
    | Fine-Tuned           | **[Score]** | **[Score]** |
    | Extra Credit (Model X) | [Score]       | [Score]                  |

    *Table 1: Core Benchmark Results Comparison.*
    ```
* **Qualitative:** Provide **one or perhaps two brief, compelling examples** (if space permits) where the fine-tuned system showed a clear difference (improvement or specific failure) compared to the baseline. Show the query, answers, and briefly explain the key difference.

---

## 5. Discussion & Conclusion

* **Interpretation:** Based on your results, did fine-tuning provide a meaningful improvement? Briefly explain *why* or *why not*, linking back to the domain challenges and benchmark results.
* **Limitations & Future Work:** Briefly mention 1-2 key limitations (e.g., data size, benchmark scope) and suggest one potential next step.
* **Conclusion:** State the main takeaway message of your project in 1-2 sentences.

## 6. References

* List key sources: base models (URLs), data sources, significant libraries/frameworks, guiding tutorials/papers. *(Use a standard format like APA, IEEE, or ACM).*
